  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <p> I read this in mid 2025. It was on of the first books I started reading from the classics collections..</p>
  <p> This one was interesting. In that it was about a girl from the city moving to a small town in America. The most memorable moment was another girls perspective, having come from a further town from the city again thinking the small town was marvellous due to her familiar conditions.

        <p>It’s slow but interesting, made me consider how. life would have been in that time, in a small town trying to improve it. </p>
        
        <p>Reminded me off my Nanna’s town Numerkah in Northern Victoria. Interesting showing everyone’s point of views on different matters and their own self interest.</p>
    
        <p>I would read it again in a few years.</p>
